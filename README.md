# Multi-line-CO-Imaging-of-Two-Ultraluminous-Infrared-Galaxies
The primary goal of this project was to use the given data of four emission lines from two ultraluminous infrared galaxies to calculate the molecular gas mass and dynamical mass of each galaxy. It was done through IDL, ds9, SExtraction software baised on Unix principles
